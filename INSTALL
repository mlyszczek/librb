Requirements:

  * libc (glibc, uclibc)
  * pthread (only if THREADS are enabled)

Install locally:

    make && make install

To install with pthread support do

    make THREADS=1 && make install

To install to different directory do

    DESTDIR=/custom/dir make install

Cross Compile:

To compile for different architecture 3 env variables should be set

  * CC - cross compiler
  * INC - staging include directory
  * LINC - staging library directory

Example make might look like this

    $ CC=arm-none-eabi \
      INC=-I/usr/arm-none-eabi/usr/include \
      LINC=-L/usr/arm-none-eabi/usr/lib \
      make

    $ DESTDIR=/usr/arm-none-eabi/usr make install
