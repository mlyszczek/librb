Requirements:

  * libc (glibc, uclibc)
  * pthread

Install locally:

make && make install

Cross Compile:

To compile for different architecture 3 env variables should be set

CC - cross compiler
INC - staging include directory
LINC - staging library directory

Example make might look like this

$ CC=arm-none-eabi \
  INC=-I/usr/arm-none-eabi/usr/include \
  LINC=-L/usr/arm-none-eabi/usr/lib \
  make

$ INSTALL_DIR=/usr/arm-none-eabi/usr make install
