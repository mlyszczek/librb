NAME
----
|rb_clear|, |rb_discard| - remove data from buffer without performing any read
or copying

SYNOPSIS
--------
.. code-block:: c

   #include <rb.h>

   int rb_clear(struct rb *rb, int clear);
   long rb_discard(struct rb *rb, size_t count);

DESCRIPTION
-----------
|rb_discard| will remove *count* elements from *rb* ring buffer. This basically
acts the same way as |rb_recv| but does not perform any copies and can never
block.

|rb_clear| will clear out whole ring buffer. If *clear* is set to 1, function
will also zero-out all buffer, which may be good if you want to remove some
confidential data from memory.

When multi-thread is enabled, |rb_clear| will block to acquire read mutex,
and if *clear* is set it may also wake up threads blocked in write. These woken
threads may return **EAGAIN** errors during the clear operation.
